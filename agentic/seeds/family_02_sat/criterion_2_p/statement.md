# Problem B — Paired Window Constraints

Time limit: 1 s   Memory limit: 256 MB

The same project now has requirements that each list exactly two task-state
conditions instead of three. Decide whether all tasks can be assigned states
satisfying every requirement, and if so, output any valid assignment.

## Input
The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5).
Each of the next m lines contains two non-zero signed integers l1 l2, with
|li| ≤ n. At least one of the two stated conditions must hold.

## Output
If no valid assignment exists, print a single line NO.
Otherwise print YES on the first line. On the second line print n integers
s1 s2 … sn (each in {0, 1}) forming any valid assignment.

## Example 1
Input:
```
2 2
1 2
-1 -2
```
Output:
```
YES
1 0
```

## Example 2
Input:
```
1 2
1 1
-1 -1
```
Output:
```
NO
```

## Note
Multiple valid assignments may exist; any one is accepted. The same task index
may appear in multiple requirements.
